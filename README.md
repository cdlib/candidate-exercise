# CDL programming exercise

This small Spring Boot application is the first attempt at a REST service that retrieves information about an accordion inventory. 
An application that consumes this service can get a list of all the accordions, or filter it to see only accordions that match certain criteria.

However, a brief examination of the code reveals that it is a crude prototype and needs considerable refactoring before 
you can start the work of making any functional changes.

Your task is to clean up and restructure the code, so that it will be readable, testable, and scalable as you or your teammates starts to add new functionality.

There are no restrictions on the type of changes you can make to the code.

If you have time, extend the list of criteria that the user can use to select their accordion list.

If there is refactoring that you would like to postpone until later, document using TODO comments in the code.
